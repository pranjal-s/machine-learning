    "The California housing dataset provides median house prices for California districts from a 1990 census. Our goal here will be to build a ML model to predict median house prices using this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is an old dataset, we can't use it to predict current prices. Hence, I will be splitting the dataset into training and test sets. We will use the test set to check performance of the final model. Also, since we need to compare performance of models for model selection, I would use k-fold cross validation during the training. This way, we would have an out-of-sample error measure of various models.  "

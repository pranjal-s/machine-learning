Machine Learning Regression Tasks using ScikitLearn

## prices
In this project, I worked out an end-to-end Scikit-Learn ML model detailing data preprocessing and ML modeling strategies step by step. The project features advanced techniques in feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

The model development is done in the Jupyter notebook viewable at this link: https://github.com/pranjal-s/ml-regression/blob/main/prices_development.ipynb

The production code can be viewed at this link: https://github.com/pranjal-s/ml-regression/blob/main/prices_production.ipynb (Being added)
